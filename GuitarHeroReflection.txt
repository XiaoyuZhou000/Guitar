Assesement 2: GuitarHero Reflection

1) What did you learn from working on this 
assignment?
Array can be the array for all the object. The array of the object is a good 
way to store a series of same type data.

2) What did you struggle most with on this 
assignment? How did you work to overcome 
that struggle (even if you weren't able to)?
I struggle how to create array of GuitarString first and I look up the syntax 
of array and example code to solve that. And then debugging is the most struggling 
problem. I posted questions on ed and asked for help.

3) How will you use what you learned from 
this assignment to improve your process or 
approach on future assignments?
The first skill I learned is that in the calculation process, the number should be calculated
with decimal point for accuracy. The second skill is about array of an object.

4) Was any part of the specification or 
requirements unclear? If so, what part(s), 
and how could it have been made clearer?
If there are more instruction about the function of the code, that will be better.

5) About how many hours did you spend working 
on this assignment? (Estimates are fine, but 
try to get close)
reading specification: 0.5h
coding: 1h
debugging: 2h over 3 days
commenting: less than 1h
